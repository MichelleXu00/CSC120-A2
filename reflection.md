What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I successfully assigned the tasks/attributes to different classes and some methods in the files. However, I have some troubles with figuring out the item_id for the program to keep track. Also, I don't really understand how to convert procedural program into object-orientated program. I would suggest people to go to tutoring sessions and/or join study groups to work on assignment.
